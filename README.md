# WebViewer UI

WebViewer UI sits on top of [WebViewer](https://pdftron.com/webviewer), a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that's part of the [PDFTron PDF SDK](https://pdftron.com). Built in React, WebViewer UI provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.

This repo is specifically designed for any users interested in advanced customizations. With the source code access, it gives developers full control to customize & style the UI, build custom controls & logic, integrate into workflows, or build a UI from scratch.
